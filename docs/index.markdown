## What am I trying to achieve?
My research explores how to effectively design and deploy autonomous social robots in public spaces that are accepted by their users and organisations. I, along with my supervisors Dr. Mary Ellen Foster and Dr. Peggy Gregory, seek to achieve this through three main contributions to the field: by adapting and utilising existing human-centric Software Engineering and Project Management practices to the robotics domain; exploring the perceived notions of value that robots carry amongst diverse stakeholders; and finally quantifying the effect our new development processes have on overall acceptance of the robot from both an end user and organisational perspective.
